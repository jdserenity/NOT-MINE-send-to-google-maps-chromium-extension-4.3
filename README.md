# Send to Google Maps

Send to Google Maps Chrome extension: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-google-maps/bhggankplfegmjjngfmhfajedmiikolo)

Sends the current text selection with 1-Click to Google Maps.

This extension allows you to send a selected address on any website directly to Google Maps.

Therefore the extension adds an item to the Context Menu if text is selected. By right clicking on the selected text the context menu opens and you can choose between different options:

- Search for the selected text in Maps
- Show your current position in Maps
- If you need directions:
  Just go to the options page and enter up to five favorite addresses. They will be available in the context menu to easily get directions.

Also, you can select company names, names of sights and a lot more on any webpage to get directions to. Just try it out! It's not limited to addresses only...
